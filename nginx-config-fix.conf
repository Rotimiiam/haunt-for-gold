# Updated Nginx configuration for Haunt For Gold
# The main "/" location needs WebSocket headers too

# Replace your current location / block with this:

location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    
    # WebSocket upgrade headers (IMPORTANT - add these!)
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    
    # Headers for proper proxying
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    
    # Bypass cache for WebSocket
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    
    # Timeouts (increase for WebSocket)
    proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
    proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
    proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
}

# Your /socket.io/ location looks fine, keep it as is.

# After updating, run:
# sudo nginx -t
# sudo systemctl reload nginx
